# Jiffy-Labs-Assignment
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This React application showcases your front-end development skills using React, TypeScript, Sass, and ESLint. It serves as a solution to the Front-End Skill Test provided by Jiffy Labs, adhering to the design specifications outlined in the Figma link (access may require permission):

[Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/design/8WTQQocoleXPrm8qeBZFse/Front-End-Skill-Test?node-id=1-82&t=TjhqweytS1HA6VLE-0)

**Technologies Used:**

* React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* TypeScript: A superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing for improved code maintainability and early error detection.
* Sass: A preprocessor for CSS that provides features like variables, nesting, mixins, and functions for more organized and maintainable styles.
* ESLint: A linter that enforces coding standards and identifies potential issues in your JavaScript code.

**Current Scope:**

This initial implementation focuses on delivering the core functionalities as per the Figma design, optimized for a screen size of 1920x970.

**Future Improvements:**

* **Responsiveness:** The application will be enhanced to adapt its layout and components seamlessly across various screen sizes (desktops, tablets, mobiles) for a wider audience.
**Installation and Setup:**

1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Node.js (LTS or later) and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.
2. **Clone Repository:** Clone this repository using Git:
